    Added most of the functionality to Utils.py. Need to check if you can add functions to the modules (e.g.  for validating that a type is 
    valid in a list/ array) and improve documentation (both docstring and inline comments).

    Added functionality to the main_menu() function in main.py. Should it be implemented with a series of if elif else statements as these 
    were more heavily shown in lectures. Should quit be implemented within the quit function or is it fine how it is.
    Added functionality to the reporting_menu().
    Need to do the get_data() function to read the CSV data. Read all the data and return as an embedded dictionary.
    Find a less clunky way to validate inputs.
    Create a requirements.txt file for the VENV.
